    subtitle: '合気道とは',
    p1: 'The spirit of Aikido, as expressed in the word \u201caiki,\u201d lies in the attitude of living together in harmony without conflict. Aikido is not merely a martial art for fighting, but a path to protect both oneself and others, and to build peace.',
    p2: 'For this reason, Aikido emphasizes not clashing with force, but accepting and redirecting the opponent\u2019s energy to create harmony. Through training, practitioners cultivate both body and mind, nurture a spirit of respect, and value mutual growth over victory or defeat.',
    p3: 'This spirit extends beyond the dojo into everyday life, fostering the ability to respond flexibly in the face of difficulties, to seek harmony in human relationships, and to achieve inner stability through proper posture and breathing.',
