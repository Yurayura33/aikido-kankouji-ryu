        <p>
          The spirit of Aikido, as expressed in the word "aiki," lies in the attitude of living
          together in harmony without conflict. Aikido is not merely a martial art for fighting, but
          a path to protect both oneself and others, and to build peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, Aikido emphasizes not clashing with force, but accepting and redirecting
          the opponent's energy to create harmony. Through training, practitioners cultivate both
          body and mind, nurture a spirit of respect, and value mutual growth over victory or defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spirit extends beyond the dojo into everyday life, fostering the ability to respond
          flexibly in the face of difficulties, to seek harmony in human relationships, and to
          achieve inner stability through proper posture and breathing.
