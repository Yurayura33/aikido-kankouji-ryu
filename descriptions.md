I want to create a static website with the following details.
This will be used for a business to start a dojo.
Please make it professional and secure.

Title:
合気道 冠光寺流(かんこうじりゅう)

Description:
What is Aiki-do?
The spirit of Aikido, as expressed in the word "aiki," lies in the attitude of living together in harmony without conflict. Aikido is not merely a martial art for fighting, but a path to protect both oneself and others, and to build peace. For this reason, Aikido emphasizes not clashing with force, but accepting and redirecting the opponent's energy to create harmony. Through training, practitioners cultivate both body and mind, nurture a spirit of respect, and value mutual growth over victory or defeat. This spirit extends beyond the dojo into everyday life, fostering the ability to respond flexibly in the face of difficulties, to seek harmony in human relationships, and to achieve inner stability through proper posture and breathing.
